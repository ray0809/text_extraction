text_extraction
===============

This code is the implementation of the method proposed in the paper “Multi-script text extraction from natural scenes” (Gomez &amp; Karatzas), International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR2013.

This code should reproduce the same quantitative results published on the paper for the KAIST dataset (for the task of text segmentation at pixel level). If you plan to compare this method with your's in other datasets please drop us a line ({lgomez,dimos}@cvc.uab.es). Thanks!

  How to run the code
  ===============
  cd text_extraction
  
  cmake CMakeLists.txt
  
  make
  
  then will produce a bin file named 'text_extraction'
  
  ./text_extraction your_pic_path
